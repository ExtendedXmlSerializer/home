# [ExtendedXmlSerializer v3.0.0](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/releases/tag/3.0.0)
> 12/03/2019 07:15:01 UTC
##### ``3.0.0``
This is our first release that makes use of NextRelease (https://www.nextrelease.io/)

As such, starting with this release we aim to incorporate better release notes, as well as adhere to Semantic Versioning in a more disciplined manner.  Unfortunately, we incorporated NextRelease after work began on this release, so we&#39;re missing some issues generated by NextRelease in this copy, so we&#39;ll make mention of them here in this summary.

The first being that we have some breaking changes with this release, which you can see in this issue:
https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/issues/289

Secondly, I&#39;m happy to announce that we have a _bunch_ of documentation now!  I&#39;ve been spending the past few weeks slogging through the necessary (and painful &#128517;) brain dump required to get the information stored in my noggin over this project into words that can be digested by others.

To start, we have all the publicly-exposed API members documented in XML format throughout the project. #189

We also have our wiki nicely rounded out, complete with examples and API overview:
https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/wiki

But that&#39;s not all. &#128513;  We now have a documentation site that is deployed on every release, generated by [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/):
https://extendedxmlserializer.github.io/documentation/

It also contains API reference (generated by our XML documentation in source):
https://extendedxmlserializer.github.io/documentation/reference/

And conceptual documentation (which is a mirror of our wiki):
https://extendedxmlserializer.github.io/documentation/conceptual/

Third (and finally!), it is worth mentioning that we have a new home and URL as you can see in the provided links throughout the summary and can be found here:

https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/home/

Please update any git references you have to our new location on the GitHubs.

Before closing out, I would like to personally thank @WojciechNagorski for being so gracious in passing off the keys to his baby to me (@Mike-EEE).   It has enabled us to take the next step here with ExtendedXmlSerializer, and to round out a few of the missing pieces as described above.   @WojciechNagorski will still be involved, but we both decided that it would be best if I take over the reigns to this project, as it basically has been mine since v2 began.  Needless to say, it&#39;s been a well-accepted learning lesson for us both.

With that, I would like to sign off on this release and send a BIG thank you to everyone who has supported and uses ExtendedXmlSerializer!
