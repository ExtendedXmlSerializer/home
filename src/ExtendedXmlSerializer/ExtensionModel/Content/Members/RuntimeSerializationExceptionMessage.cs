- Each member must not already be marked as an explicit contract
- Must be a public fields / property.
- Any public fields (spit) must be readonly
- Any public properties must have a get but not a set (on the public API, at least)
- There must be exactly one interesting constructor, with parameters that are a case-insensitive match for each field/property in some order (i.e. there must be an obvious 1:1 mapping between members and constructor parameter names)
